Blazing fast [TPCH] benchmark data generator, in pure Rust with zero dependencies.

[TPCH]: https://www.tpc.org/tpch/


## Features
1. Blazing Speed ðŸš€
2. Obsessively Tested ðŸ“‹
3. Fully parallel, streaming, reasonable memory usage ðŸ§ 

## Try  now!
First [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and this tool:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
cargo install tpchgen-cli
```

```shell
# create Scale Factor 10 (3.6GB, 8 files, 60M rows in lineitem) in 5 seconds on a modern laptop
tpchgen-cli -s 10 --format=parquet
```

## Performance

![Parquet Generation Performance](parquet-performance.png)

[`tpchgen-cli`](tpchgen-cli/README.md) is more than 10x faster than any other
TPCH generator we know of. On a 2023 Mac M3 Max laptop, it easily generates data
faster than can be written to SSD. See [BENCHMARKS.md](benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md)
for more details on performance and benchmarking.

## Testing

This crate has extensive tests to ensure correctness. We compare the output of
this crate with the original `dbgen` implementation as part of every checkin.
See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for more details.

## Crates

* `tpchgen` is the library that implements the data generation logic for TPCH
  and it can be used to embed data generation logic natively in Rust.
  
# `tpchgen-arrow` is a library for generating in memory [Apache Arrow] 
  record batches for each of the TPCH tables

* `tpchgen-cli` is a [`dbgen`](https://github.com/databricks/tpch-dbgen)
  compatible CLI tool that generates tables from the TPCH benchmark dataset.
